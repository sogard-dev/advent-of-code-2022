Finished: **25/25**

These are my Rust solutions for Advent Of Code 2022.

I'm by no means a Rust expert and did not spend any time making the solutions prettier between answer and committing in almost all cases. 

The code screams "this could have been done better / in a a more Rusty way", but I'm still using Rust like a Java developer because, well, I mostly code in Java - But practice makes perfect right, slow and steady.
